# Todo List SwiftUI (Underdog Fantasy)

## Welcome to my Project üéâüéä.

## 1 - Architecture and Patterns

Some of the patterns and architecture this project is using are:

* [MVVM](https://medium.com/@abhilash.mathur1891/mvvm-in-ios-swift-aa1448a66fb4) as the main Architecture.
* [Clean Architecture](https://medium.com/@salma.salah.ashour/mvp-mvvm-and-clean-architecture-in-ios-49643b456a5) it helps to follow S.O.L.I.D principles.
* [Factory Pattern](https://stevenpcurtis.medium.com/the-factory-pattern-using-swift-b534ae9f983f) to generate View Models / UseCases.
* [Protocol Orient Programming (pop).](https://www.raywenderlich.com/6742901-protocol-oriented-programming-tutorial-in-swift-5-1-getting-started)

Observation:
I know this is a simple project and I only needed to use MVVM, however I decided to implement MVVM with clean architecture just to show /simulate how scalable and testable this app could be if was a real project. I added some unit testing just for fun, hope you enjoy ‚ò∫Ô∏è.
